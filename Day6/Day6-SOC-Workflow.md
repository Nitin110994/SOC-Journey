# Day 6 – SOC Workflow & Alert Lifecycle

## What happens when an alert is generated?
When an alert is generated, it appears in the SOC dashboard or queue. A SOC analyst reviews the alert details such as host, user, time, and alert type and begins triage.

## Why is alert triage important?
Alert triage helps determine whether an alert is a true positive or a false positive. It prevents wasting time on normal activity and ensures real threats are handled quickly.

## Difference between High and Critical severity
High severity alerts indicate strong signs of malicious activity with limited impact. Critical severity alerts indicate confirmed attacks or system compromise with high business impact.

## Why does SOC documentation matter?
SOC documentation records investigation steps and decisions, helps with audits, allows knowledge sharing between analysts, and supports future investigations.

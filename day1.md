# Day 1 - Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Notes

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

### Offensive vs Defensive Security
- **Offensive Security**: Simulating hacker actions to find vulnerabilities.
- **Defensive Security**: Protecting, detecting, monitoring, and responding to attacks.

### Example Used
- Explained how an attacker could try to hack a bank account using tools like gobbuster.

### Cybersecurity Career Paths
- Penetration Tester
- Red Teamer
- Security Engineer
